## ⚡️ Quickstart
### Installation
```bash
python3 download_weights.py
conda create -n dreamid_omni python=3.11
conda activate dreamid_omni
pip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision torchaudio
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flash_attn --no-build-isolation
```
### Inference

#### Single-GPU inference
``` sh
python3 inference_r2av.py --config-file dreamid_omni/configs/inference/inference_r2av.yaml
```

#### Multi-GPU inference
``` sh
torchrun --nnodes 1 --nproc_per_node 8 inference_r2av.py --config-file dreamid_omni/configs/inference/inference_r2av.yaml
```
Before running multi-GPU inference, please open `dreamid_omni/configs/inference/inference_r2av.yaml` and set sp_size: 8



## 🎨 How to Create 
Our prompts use the following special tags to control characters and speech:
- **Subject Identity**: `<sub1>`, `<sub2>` - Represents the character IPs provided in your input images (e.g., `<img1>` corresponds to `<sub1>`). Use these tags in your prompt to specify who is acting or speaking.
- **Speech**: `<S>Your speech content here<E>` - Text enclosed in these tags will be converted to speech using the corresponding character's reference audio.
### 💡 Structure Example
We provide example prompts to help you get started with DreamID-Omni:
- **Single-person generation**: `test_case/oneip`
- **Multi-person generation**: `test_case/twoip`
